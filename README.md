This project is a mini e-commerce web application that simulates an online shopping experience with cart, checkout, and order history features. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers and a monitoring dashboard for administrators.

Users can browse a product catalog, add or remove items from their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout. Once checkout is completed, the order is saved and can be reviewed later in the order history section. Each order contains product details, total price, and timestamp.

For administrators, the system includes a dedicated Admin Panel where all orders placed by users are displayed. This helps in monitoring user activity and managing sales records.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of session handling, order management, and CRUD operations commonly used in e-commerce platforms.
